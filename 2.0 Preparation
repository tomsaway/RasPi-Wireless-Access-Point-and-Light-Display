2.0 Preparation
For the reader to use these instructions, they will need to have all equipment in section
“1.3 What you’ll need”, stretch should also be installed and working on the Raspberry Pi.
If not, another instruction will need to be sourced to get to that point. These next steps
will set your Raspberry Pi up to ensure the rest of the process will flow nicely. All
commands are run in the terminal window. These instructions can be done either via ssh
connection (with Ethernet cable connected) or locally with keyboard and mouse.


2.1 WiFi location

2.1.1 Open the Terminal Window. All commands in these instructions should be
entered into the terminal window. Your input will appear after the ..$. sign at each
stage.

2.1.2 Before we start we should ensure the Raspberry Pi is up to date. Run:
sudo apt-get update .

2.1.3 Now we need to access some setting for the Raspberry Pi, run the following from
the command line:
sudo raspi-config. .

2.1.4 A blue screen with a grey box will appear as seen below.

2.1.5 Use the up and down keys to move down to highlight and select:

2.1.6 Highlight and select

2.1.7 select your country and click on ok then select finish. The system may need to
reboot to work correctly. Do this by entering
sudo reboot. .


2.2 Check MAC addresses of WLANs
There will be two WLANs (Wireless Local Area Network) in use for this project; WLAN0
and WLAN1.
• WLAN0 should be the on board WiFi device – this is also sending out a WiFi network.
• WLAN1 should be the USB connected device – this will connect all devices and the
raspberry pi to the internet.

2.2.1 To note the MAC address of you internal WiFi device first disconnect the USB
device and then run:
ifconfig. .
The MAC address will be written in hexadecimal and will be displayed next to WLAN0.

2.2.2 Now connect the USB device and repeat the process, Run:
ifconfig. .

2.2.3 Now we want to identify the initial server the system is running on, to do this run:
sudo cat /etc/resolv.conf .
Note your server address as you will need this for step 3.2.2.
